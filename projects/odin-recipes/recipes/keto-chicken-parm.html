    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast
        </li>
        <li>
            1 large egg
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
        </li>
        <li>
            1 ½ ounces pork rinds, crushed
        </li>
        <li>
            1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup jarred tomato sauce (such as Rao's®)
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice chicken breast through the middle horizontally from one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Pound chicken flat until about 1/2-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat egg and cream together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, red pepper, black pepper, and Italian seasoning in a separate shallow bowl or plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip chicken into egg mixture; coat completely. Press chicken into breading; thickly coat both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add ghee. Place chicken in the pan; cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Be careful to keep breading in place.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Cover with tomato sauce; top with mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
