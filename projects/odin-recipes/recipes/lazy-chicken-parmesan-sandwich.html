    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>
        Wanted to eat a chicken Parmesan sub but didn't feel like spending the time cooking and breading chicken. So I opted to cut corners using frozen chicken patties and pre-prepared ingredients to make my life easier. Picked up the sub rolls and couldn't justify eating that many calories, so opted instead for sliced Italian bread and thin-sliced cheese. Turned out so surprisingly good, I thought I'd share. Enjoy!

        <li>
             2 Frozen Breaded Chicken Patties
            </li>
        <li>
            2 Tablespoons Garlic Butter, or to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            4 Slices Italian Bread
        </li>
        <li>
            1 Cup Marinara Sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 Teaspoon Dried Basil
            , or to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 Pinch Garlic Salt, or to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            6 Thin Slices Provolone Cheese
        </li>
        <li>
            2 Tablespoons Shredded Parmesan Cheese
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place chicken patties on a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crispy, about 20 minutes. Cut chicken patties in half lengthwise.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread garlic butter onto 1 side of each bread slice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix marinara sauce, basil, and garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warmed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1 bread slice, butter-side down, into a skillet; top with 2 slices provolone cheese, 1 tablespoon marinara sauce, 2 chicken patty halves, overlapped to cover bread, 2 tablespoons marinara sauce, 1 slice provolone cheese, and bread, butter-side up. Cook over medium heat until bread is crisp and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over remaining marinara sauce and serve alongside each sandwich.
        </li>
    </ol>
