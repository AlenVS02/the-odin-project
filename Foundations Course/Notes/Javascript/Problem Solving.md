## The  Steps to Problem Solving

#### 1. Understand the problem
To solve a problem, one must know **exactly** what the problem is. To gain a deeper understanding of the problem, write it down, reword it in plain English, and draw diagrams. If you can explain to another person, you understand it.

#### 2. Plan
Important questions to ask yourself before jumping into coding:
- Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out.
- What inputs will your program have>? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
- What's the desired output?
- Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

**Pseudocode**
Writing out the logic of your program in natural language helps you think through the steps.

Example of a pseudocode for a program that prints all numbers up to an inputted number:

```
When the user inputs a number
Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
Print the value of the counter variable
```

#### 3. Divide and Conquer
When encountering sufficiently complex problems, don't dive head-first into it. Rather, divide the problem into sub-problems you can identify.
